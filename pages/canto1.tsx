        <p>MIDWAY upon the journey of our life 🌳<br />
        I found myself within a forest dark, 🌚<br />
        For the straightforward pathway had been lost. 🌀</p>

        <p>Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say 😓<br />
        What was this forest savage, rough, and stern, 🐺<br />
        Which in the very thought renews the fear. 😱</p>

        <p>So bitter is it, death is little more; ☠️<br />
      But of the good to treat, which there I found, 🌟<br />
      Speak will I of the other things I saw there. 👀</p>

      <p>I cannot well repeat how there I entered, 🚪<br />
      So full was I of slumber at the moment 😴<br />
      In which I had abandoned the true way. ❌</p>

      <p>But after I had reached a mountain&apos;s foot, 🏔️<br />
      At that point where the valley terminated, 🏞️<br />
      Which had with consternation pierced my heart, 💔</p>

      <p>Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders 👀<br />
      Vested already with that planet&apos;s rays ☀️<br />
      Which leadeth others right by every road. 🛤️</p>

      <p>Then was the fear a little quieted 😌<br />
      That in my heart&apos;s lake had endured throughout 💖<br />
      The night, which I had passed so piteously 🌙</p>

      <p>And even as he, who, with distressful breath, 😰<br />
      Forth issued from the sea upon the shore, 🌊<br />
      Turns to the water perilous and gazes; 👁️</p>

      <p>So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward, 🏃<br />
      Turn itself back to re-behold the pass 👀<br />
      Which never yet a living person left. 🚫</p>

      <p>After my weary body I had rested, 💤<br />
      The way resumed I on the desert slope, 🏜️<br />
      So that the firm foot ever was the lower. 👣</p>

      <p>And lo! almost where the ascent began, 🏞️<br />
      A panther light and swift exceedingly, 🐆<br />
      Which with a spotted skin was covered o&apos;er!</p>

      <p>And never moved she from before my face, 😨<br />
      Nay, rather did impede so much my way, 🚫<br />
      That many times I to return had turned.</p>

      <p>The time was the beginning of the morning, 🌅<br />
      And up the sun was mounting with those stars ☀️✨<br />
      That with him were, what time the Love Divine</p>

      <p>At first in motion set those beauteous things; 🌠<br />
      So were to me occasion of good hope, 🙏<br />
      The variegated skin of that wild beast,</p>

      <p>The hour of time, and the delicious season; 🕰️🌸<br />
      But not so much, that did not give me fear 😰<br />
      A lion&apos;s aspect which appeared to me. 🦁</p>

      <p>He seemed as if against me he were coming 🐾<br />
      With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger, 🍖<br />
      So that it seemed the air was afraid of him; 💨</p>

      <p>And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings 🐺<br />
      Seemed to be laden in her meagreness, 💀<br />
      And many folk has caused to live forlorn!</p>

      <p>She brought upon me so much heaviness, 😔<br />
      With the affright that from her aspect came, 😱<br />
      That I the hope relinquished of the height. 🏔️</p>

      <p>And as he is who willingly acquires, 💰<br />
      And the time comes that causes him to lose, 📉<br />
      Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,</p>

      <p>E&apos;en such made me that beast withouten peace, 🌪️<br />
      Which, coming on against me by degrees 🐾<br />
      Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent 🌑</p>

      <p>While I was rushing downward to the lowland, 🏃‍♂️<br />
      Before mine eyes did one present himself, 👤<br />
      Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.</p>

      <p>When I beheld him in the desert vast, 🏜️<br />
      "Have pity on me," unto him I cried, 🗣️<br />
      "Whiche&apos;er thou art, or shade or real man!"</p>

      <p>He answered me: "Not man; man once I was, 👻<br />
      And both my parents were of Lombardy, 🇮🇹<br />
      And Mantuans by country both of them.</p>

      <p>Sub Julio was I born, though it was late, ⏳<br />
      And lived at Rome under the good Augustus, 🏛️<br />
      During the time of false and lying gods.</p>

      <p>A poet was I, and I sang that just 📜<br />
      Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy, 🏴‍☠️<br />
      After that Ilion the superb was burned</p>

      <p>But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance? 🤔<br />
      Why climb&apos;st thou not the Mount Delectable 🏔️<br />
      Which is the source and cause of every joy?"</p>

      <p>Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain 🧙‍♂️<br />
      Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?" 🌊<br />
      I made response to him with bashful forehead.</p>

      <p>"O, of the other poets honour and light, 🏆<br />
      Avail me the long study and great love 📚❤️<br />
      That have impelled me to explore thy volume!</p>

      <p>Thou art my master, and my author thou, 🎓<br />
      Thou art alone the one from whom I took 🖋️<br />
      The beautiful style that has done honour to me.</p>

      <p>Behold the beast, for which I have turned back; 🐺<br />
      Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage, 🛡️<br />
      For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble."</p>

      <p>"Thee it behoves to take another road," 🛣️<br />
      Responded he, when he beheld me weeping, 😢<br />
      "If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;</p>

      <p>Because this beast, at which thou criest out, 🐺<br />
      Suffers not any one to pass her way, 🚫<br />
      But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;</p>

      <p>And has a nature so malign and ruthless, 😈<br />
      That never doth she glut her greedy will, 🍖<br />
      And after food is hungrier than before.</p>

      <p>Many the animals with whom she weds, 🐾<br />
      And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound 🐕<br />
      Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.</p>

      <p>He shall not feed on either earth or pelf, 🌍💰<br />
      But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue; 📚❤️✨<br />
      &apos;Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;</p>

      <p>Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour, 🇮🇹<br />
      On whose account the maid Camilla died, ⚔️<br />
      Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;</p>

      <p>Through every city shall he hunt her down, 🏙️<br />
      Until he shall have driven her back to Hell, 🔥<br />
      There from whence envy first did let her loose.</p>

      <p>Therefore I think and judge it for thy best 🤔<br />
      Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide, 🧭<br />
      And lead thee hence through the eternal place,</p>

      <p>Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations, 😭<br />
      Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate, 👻<br />
      Who cry out each one for the second death;</p>

      <p>And thou shalt see those who contented are 😌<br />
      Within the fire, because they hope to come, 🔥<br />
      Whene&apos;er it may be, to the blessed people;</p>

      <p>To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend, 🚀<br />
      A soul shall be for that than I more worthy; 👼<br />
      With her at my departure I will leave thee;</p>

      <p>Because that Emperor, who reigns above, 👑<br />
      In that I was rebellious to his law, ⚖️<br />
      Wills that through me none come into his city.</p>

      <p>He governs everywhere and there he reigns; 🌌<br />
      There is his city and his lofty throne; 🏛️<br />
      O happy he whom thereto he elects!"</p>

      <p>And I to him: "Poet, I thee entreat, 🙏<br />
      By that same God whom thou didst never know, ✝️<br />
      So that I may escape this woe and worse,</p>

      <p>Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said, 🚶‍♂️<br />
      That I may see the portal of Saint Peter, 🚪<br />
      And those thou makest so disconsolate."</p>

      <p>Then he moved on, and I behind him followed. 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♂️</p>

          Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;<br />
          <br />
          Through every city shall he hunt her down,<br />
          Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,<br />
          There from whence envy first did let her loose.<br />
          <br />
          Therefore I think and judge it for thy best<br />
          Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,<br />
          And lead thee hence through the eternal place,<br />
          <br />
          Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,<br />
          Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,<br />
          Who cry out each one for the second death;<br />
          <br />
          And thou shalt see those who contented are<br />
          Within the fire, because they hope to come,<br />
          Whene&apos;er it may be, to the blessed people;<br />
          <br />
          To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,<br />
          A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;<br />
          With her at my departure I will leave thee;<br />
          <br />
          Because that Emperor, who reigns above,<br />
          In that I was rebellious to his law,<br />
          Wills that through me none come into his city.<br />
          <br />
          He governs everywhere and there he reigns;<br />
          There is his city and his lofty throne;<br />
          O happy he whom thereto he elects!”<br />
          <br />
          And I to him: “Poet, I thee entreat,<br />
          By that same God whom thou didst never know,<br />
          So that I may escape this woe and worse,<br />
          <br />
          Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,<br />
          That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,<br />
          And those thou makest so disconsolate.”<br />
          <br />
          Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.
