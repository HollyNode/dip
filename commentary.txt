THE FIRST CANTO OF DANTE'S COMEDY BEGINS.

In this first canto, the author discusses sinners and sins, adapting the punishments to the sins according to human reason. This first canto contains thirty-four cantos, the title of the first canto being: The First Canto of the First Canticle of the Comedy Begins.

In this first canto, the author broadly and generally introduces the entire Comedy and primarily includes two things: First, how he, wanting to ascend the mountain of virtues, was impeded by three vices, namely lust, pride, and greed, which are represented and symbolized by three beasts that appeared to him: the leopard, the lion, and the she-wolf. Second, he describes how Virgil, the greatest of poets, came to his aid, representing human reason, through which he promises to show him Hell and Purgatory. But since human reason cannot reach divine and celestial contemplation, he promises to show him Paradise, not by himself, but through a heavenly guide or leader. Having seen the title, let us investigate the text. Note, however, that it is not my intention to proceed in this work at every step or place in the manner of rhetorical, natural, or moral science, dividing singularly and multiply, but to focus on the text of each canto, summarizing its essence and demonstrating through each canto the path the author takes, descending or ascending, how many stories, questions, and even prophecies occur, and how many comparisons or similes and notable points he makes.

TRANSLATION OF THE TEXT FROM THE VERNACULAR INTO LATIN.

Verses 1-3

In the year of Our Lord 1300, in which year there was a general remission of all sins in Rome, with Boniface VIII seated in the Holy Roman See, and the Holy Roman Empire vacant, in the month of March, on Good Friday, that is, the day Christ died, at dawn, this poet...

More poetically, he pretends that he saw this Comedy, that is, everything contained within it, in a vision. Hence, he says in the text: “In the middle of the journey of our life,”

For the middle of human life, according to Aristotle, is sleep. That he began to see his visions at dawn is evident from the text there: "The time was the beginning of the morning."


Verses 4-6

He then explains what and how this forest was, saying:

“To tell what it was is hard—almost so bitter that death is hardly more so. But to treat of the good that I found there, I will tell of the other things I saw there.”

That is, to describe this forest, how vast and what kind it was, is arduous and difficult. But I will say this much about it: it was so wild, rugged, and harsh that when I remember it, even in that thought, it renews in me fear and dread alike.

Verses 7-9

He concludes that everything he saw and felt in that forest, which indeed he cannot recount in a single word, saying:

“So bitter that death is hardly more so. But to treat of the good that I found there, I will tell of the other things I saw there.”

That is: this forest is so bitter that even death, which is more bitter than any bitterness, seems only a little more so. But to recount the good that he could extract from it, he promises to tell of other things he saw there.

Verses 10-12

He explains why he cannot recount everything he saw in that forest, saying:

"I cannot rightly tell how I entered there, I was so full of sleep just at the moment when I abandoned the true way."

That is, at the point where I deserted the right path, I was so weighed down with heavy sleep that I cannot recount the beginning of my vision. The author, walking or rather straying and wandering through the confusion of that forest, finally came to the foot of a hill, which marks the end of that valley that had wounded his heart with horrible fear.

Verses 13-18

Then he lifted his eyes to a mountain covered with the rays of that planet that leads everyone straight along every path. Thus he says in the text:

"But then, I reached the foot of a hill, where the valley ended that had pierced my heart with fear, I looked up and saw its shoulders clad already in the rays of the planet that leads others straight along every path."

Verses 19-24

Then the fear that had lasted in the lake of his heart, because of the dark passage he made during the night, which signifies nothing but the horrible shadows that obscure and terrify that forest, for there is no day but perpetual night, was somewhat calmed when he saw the mountain illuminated by the brightest rays. Note that he says somewhat and not entirely, because it happens to him as it usually happens to a sailor, who, after escaping the dangers of the sea and reaching the shore, still has labored breath out of undigested fear. And with such breath, as soon as he disembarks from the ship, he turns towards the sea dangers he escaped. Thus he says in the text:

"Then fear a little quieted that had endured in the lake of my heart during the night I passed with so much distress. And like one who with labored breath, having escaped the sea to the shore, turns to the perilous water and gazes,"

Verses 25-27

With the example of the sailors given, he says that his spirit, still fleeing the perils of the forest, turned back to reconsider the passage which no living person has ever escaped. Almost saying: I turned to consider and imagine the sins and crimes I left behind, which no living person can escape, for there is no one who lives and does not sin. Thus he says in the text:

"So my spirit, still fleeing, turned back to see the pass that no living person ever left."

Verses 28-30

After escaping the forest, he states that after reaching the foot of the mountain, he did two things: first, he gave his exhausted body a little rest; second, after his body was refreshed, he began again to ascend the deserted slope, which he had previously thought to undertake. He explains his manner of ascending by saying that his lower foot was always the firmer. And this is what he says in the text:

"After resting my tired body a little, I resumed the way over the deserted slope, so that the firmer foot was always the lower one."

Verses 31-48

"And behold, almost at the start of the steep incline, a light and swift leopard, covered with a spotted hide; and it did not depart from before my face, but rather impeded my path so much that I was often turned to retreat."

"The time was at the beginning of the morning, and the sun was rising with those stars that were with him when divine love first moved those beautiful things; so that the sight of that spotted skin was cause of hope for me, despite the time and the gentle season."

Almost saying: The sun, which was now ascending from the lower hemisphere to our upper hemisphere, and the dawn, which preceded it, gave me confidence against that deceitful and treacherous beast, but not so much that it did not still cause me fear when a lion appeared that came towards me with its head raised and ravenous hunger, so swiftly that it seemed the air trembled. Therefore, in the text it immediately follows:

"But not so much that it did not give me fear at the sight of a lion that appeared to come against me with its head high and with ravenous hunger, so that it seemed that the air trembled."

Verses 49-54

After stating the obstacles he sustained from the leopard and the lion, he begins to recount the third, saying that a she-wolf, appearing burdened with all cravings and hunger in her leanness, and that had already made many people live in sorrow, caused him so much grief that the author lost the hope he had of reaching that height. Thus he says in the text:

"And a she-wolf, that seemed laden with all cravings in her leanness, and had already made many people live in grief, gave me such a heavy burden with the fear that emanated from her sight, that I lost hope of reaching the height."
